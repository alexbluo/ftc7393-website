## Getting Started

### Installation

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Run `npm i -g yarn` to install the Yarn package manager

### Running Locally

- Run `yarn` to install the newest project dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the local development server
- Open `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the development page. Changes in the code will be automatically reflected in localhost but won't be publicly visible until pushed to Vercel production

### Pushing Changes to Github

- After making changes (instructions below), double check to make sure you are inside the root directory
- In the command line, enter:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "[MESSAGE]"`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
